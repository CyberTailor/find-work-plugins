Plugins for find-work
=====================

[![Build Status](https://drone.tildegit.org/api/badges/CyberTaIlor/find-work-plugins/status.svg)](https://drone.tildegit.org/CyberTaIlor/find-work-plugins)

find-work is a utility for Gentoo repository maintainers that helps them find
ebuilds to improve.

All plugins are separate packages but they are too small to have dedicated Git
repositories for each one.
